<h1>Interactive Curriculum Vitae - IN PROGRESS :)</h1>
<h2>This site was built using <b>PHP</b>, <b>MySQL</b>, and <b>Angular</b>.  Most of my resume is Microsoft focused, so this acts as proof I can navigate the LAMP stack.</h2>
<br />
<h4>All the data for jobs, accomplishments and skills are stored in <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> and sent in seperate arrays via a <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> generated JSON resume object that <a href="resume.php">you can inspect here</a>.  From that point, I organize the data, and display it on the page using <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</h4>
<h4>Because I need to share this quickly, I'm going intentionally light on design, reserving time for functionality.  Colors thanks to <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/lover/MissCarlyRenee/loveNote">MissCarlyRenee</a></h4>
<h4>My ideal position is technical co-founder, or employee #1 for a recently funded startup in the Orange County or San Diego area.  I prefer a culture centered around teamwork, experimentation, and people who are excited.</h4>
<h4>If you're hardcore, you might want to see <a href="https://github.com/BarnesCode/ninjaresume">this GitHub link</a>.</h4>
